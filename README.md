# tribonacci
This console application is designed to calculate n digits of the Tribonacci sequence.

The Tribonacci sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but each number is the sum of the previous three numbers instead of the previous two.

For example, the first few numbers in the sequence are:

0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, ...
